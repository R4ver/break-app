#Break
Break is a small site which will provide you with information and notifications based on data from a JSON file
It's created in a Google Material style and is also responsive.

##Resources
This app uses <b>SASS</b> and <b>jQuery</b> for styling and functionality.
To compile the SASS and get the CSS map you'll have to get a compiler. I used </b>Koala</b> for this project, It's free and works great.
The jQuery can be untouched, but if you want a minified script file, Koala also works here.
